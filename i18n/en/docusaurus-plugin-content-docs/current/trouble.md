# If you have a problem...
### In case of penetration
Due to the specifications, some clothes will inevitably penetrate. The following countermeasures are available.
- Make the breast size shape key very slightly smaller than the clothing shape key. (In most cases, this will solve the problem.)
- Make the breast squish depth shallower with "MaxSquish".
- Reduce the "Breast Rotation Contribution" so that the breasts move parallel to each other.
- Decrease the "Squash Animation Strength" to reduce the deformation when the chest is squashed.
- If you cannot help but see penetration, turn on "**Crush function off (anti-penetration)**". This method will not crush the PB, but it will not allow it to penetrate.

### If you want to restore the avatar to its original setup (new method)
Since the new method is non-destructive, you can delete marshmallow_PB_Setup under the avatar to restore the avatar to its pre-installation state.

### If you want to restore the avatar set up (old method)
If you have set up avatars using the old method, they will be duplicated, but you will need to work on the avatar and FX to restore them to their original state. Masyumaro PB nests an existing chest bone into a duplicated bone of the same name (e.g. Chest/breast_L/breast_L/...). Therefore, of the two lined-up parent-child bones of the same name, the child bone is taken out and the parent bone is deleted to restore the original. Furthermore, delete the other object named marshmallow and change the FX layer to that of the original avatar. Finally, delete "_MPB" at the end of the avatar and you are done. (If the avatar or FX name ends with _MPB, it will be played by the setup tool.)  
Please see the video for more details.

### If the blurriness is too large
Masyumaro PB can cause blurring when pressed. Basically, the shaking can be resolved by increasing the Stiffness (deformation resistance).

### In case the chest collapses on its own
If "Breast Interference with Other Players" is turned on, the chest may be squashed when this function is activated by itself due to some glitch. Basically, turning off "Breast Interference with Other Players" should resolve the problem. If anyone is willing to help us investigate the glitch, please let us know.

### If the movement of Masyumaro PB is not correct
In the case of avatars with multiple PBs, the normal settings may not be able to delete all PBs, resulting in strange movements (e.g. Vale). In this case, turn on "Delete all PBs under the avatar" to fix the problem.

### In case Masyumaro PB is not applied
If marshmallow_PB_setup remains after entering Gesture Manager or playback mode, marshmallow_PB is not applied for some reason.
